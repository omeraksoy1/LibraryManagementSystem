# Library Management System

> This is the repository for our group project on the COMP306: Database Management Systems course in Koç University.




We decided to create a Library Management System that would help organize and maintain a university library. The main purpose of the system is to process the daily borrowing & returning of books by the registered students. The database provides some information about books, authors, students, and librarians. It keeps track of a book’s borrow date, return date, and penalty according to due date. After analyzing our design and its requirements further, it became clear that the system must perform many functions in three main areas:
- Insert book, delete book, search book, borrow book, return book
- Insert student, delete student, search student
- Insert author, delete author

Furthermore, we wanted to allow the user to be able to easily analyze the data at hand, which we later designed and integrated into the system as part of the complex queries requirement of the project.
